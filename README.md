# Approximate Computing for an Extended Kalman Filtering Tracker

An implementation of online approximator for an extended Kalman filter tracker implemented over FPGA is presented.

## Getting started
Please run Demo_detailed_visualisation.m and Demo.m to simulate Figure 4 of the paper, which contains dynamic approximation via four different Kullbackâ€“Leibler (KL) thresholds.

Also, please run Demo_Exact_Computation.m for exact computation, i.e target tracking with an extended Kalman filter without any approximation.

<< Approximate Computing for an Extended Kalman Filtering Tracker >>

An implementation of the paper:
P. Garcia, M. Emambakhsh, and A. Wallace, “Learning to approximate computing at run-time,” IET 3rd International Conference on Intelligent Signal Processing (ISP 2017), to appear.

Run Demo.m to simulate Figure 4 of the paper, which contains dynamic approximation via four different Kullback–Leibler (KL) thresholds.

Run Demo_Exact_Computation.m for exact computation, i.e target tracking with an extended Kalman filter without any approximation.

These filtering approaches model circular motion for a target.
